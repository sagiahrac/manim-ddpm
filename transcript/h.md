"In fact, this single design choice sits right at the intersection of three well-known ideas.

“From the probabilistic side — we’re doing Variational Inference, maximizing the ELBO: a lower bound on the data likelihood that has been central to probabilistic modeling for decades.

“From the score-based side — that very same objective turns out to be equivalent to denoising score matching, where the model learns the gradient, or ‘score’, of the data distribution by predicting the noise.”
